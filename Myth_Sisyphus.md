Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 1
Albert Camus (1913-1960) gives a quite different account of philosophy and politics of
existentialism from that of Sartre. Perhaps the most striking difference from Sartre is his
conception of the absurd. For Sartre absurdity belongs to the world prior to activity of
consciousness, while Camus’s idea of the absurd is closer to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche—the
absurd is a direct consequence of the absence of God. Without God the discrepancy between
human aspirations and the world is acute. The human condition is characterized by the
probability of suffering and the certainty of death—a fate which human reason cannot accept as
reasonable. In the face of this absurdity, the universal reason of the Enlightenment has nothing to
say. In The Myth of Sisyphus Camus elucidates this concept of the absurd. The absurd comes
with the realization that the world is not rational: “At this point of his effort man stands face to
face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd
is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world”
(28).
This confrontation is epitomized in The Plague (1947) in the painful death of a child. The
arbitrariness of the plague parallels the absurdity of existence. The absurdity of existence raises
the question of suicide and the meaning of life thus becomes “the only truly serious
philosophical problem.” The myth of Sisyphus is a potent image of futility. Camus’ response is
that only the ‘lucid’ recognition of the absurdity of existence liberates us from belief in another
life and permits us to live for the instant, for the beauty, pleasure and the ‘implacable grandeur’
of existence. Lucidity is the clarity and courage of mind which refuses all comforting illusions
and self-deception. Lucidity is Camus’s notion comparable to Kierkegaard and Sartre’s anguish,
but in the end Camus is more positive than either Kierkegaard and Sartre. Camus concludes that
“One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”
Camus draws the political moral from his confrontation with the absurd in The Rebel
(1951) which is an ethic of uncompromising honesty and lucid revolt against absurdity. Its most
obvious enemies are found in the stifling atmosphere of conventional bourgeois morality, and
more horrifyingly, in totalitarianism, of either fascist or communist varieties. Though a member
of the communist party as a youth, Camus became openly hostile to communism, rejecting the
idea that the ends can justify the means and the arrogance of philosophies of history which claim
to know the end in advance.

Absurdity and Suicide
HERE is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is
not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest— whether
or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards.
These are games; one must first answer. And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve
our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will precede the
definitive act. These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to
the intellect.
If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the
actions it entails. I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument. Galileo, who held a scientific truth
of great importance, abjured it with the greatest ease as soon as it endangered his life. In a certain sense, he did

right.1 That truth was not worth the stake. Whether the earth or the sun revolves around the other is a matter of
[4] profound indifference. To tell the truth, it is a futile question. On the other hand, I see many people die
because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or
illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason
for dying). I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions. How to answer it?
On all essential problems (I mean thereby those that run the risk of leading to death or those that intensify
the passion of living) there are probably but two methods of thought: the method of La Palisse and the
method of Don Quixote. Solely the balance between evidence and lyricism can allow us to achieve
simultaneously emotion and lucidity. In a subject at once so humble and so heavy with emotion, the
learned and classical dialectic must yield, one can see, to a more modest attitude of mind deriving at one
and the same time from common sense and understanding.
Suicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon. On the contrary, we are
concerned here, at the outset, with the relationship between individual thought and suicide. An act like
this is prepared within the silence of the heart, as is a great work of art. The man himself is ignorant of it.
One evening he pulls the trigger or jumps. Of an apartment-building manager who had killed himself I
was told that he had lost his daughter five years before, that he had changed greatly since, and that that
experience had "undermined" him. A more exact word cannot be imagined. Beginning to think is
beginning to be undermined. Society has but [5] little connection with such beginnings. The worm is in
man's heart. That is where it must be sought. One must follow and understand this fatal game that leads
from lucidity in the face of existence to flight from light.
There are many causes for a suicide, and generally the most obvious ones were not the most
powerful. Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection. What sets off
the crisis is almost always unverifiable. Newspapers often speak of "personal sorrows" or of "incurable
illness." These explanations are plausible. But one would have to know whether a friend of the desperate
man had not that very day addressed him indifferently. He is the guilty one. For that is enough to precipitate
all the rancors and all the boredom still in suspension.2
But if it is hard to fix the precise instant, the subtle step when the mind opted for death, it is
easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing
yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not
understand it. Let's not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is
merely confessing that that "is not worth the trouble." Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue
making the gestures commanded by existence, for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying
voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, [6] the ridiculous character of that habit, the
absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of
suffering.
What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world
that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly
divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of
the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and
his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity. All healthy men having thought of their own suicide, it can be
seen, without further explanation, that there is a direct connection between this feeling and the longing for
death.
The subject of this essay is precisely this relationship between the absurd and suicide, the exact degree
to which suicide is a solution to the absurd. The principle can be established that for a man who does not cheat,
what he believes to be true must determine his action. Belief in the absurdity of existence must then dictate his

scholar's fragility may well make us smile.
2 Let us not miss this opportunity to point out the relative character of this essay. Suicide may indeed be related to much more
honorable considerations—for example, the political suicides of protest, as they were called, during the Chinese revolution.
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 3
conduct. It is legitimate to wonder, clearly and without false pathos, whether a conclusion of this importance
requires forsaking as rapidly as possible an incomprehensible condition. I am speaking, of course, of men
inclined to be in harmony with themselves.
Stated clearly, this problem may seem both simple and insoluble. But it is wrongly assumed that
simple questions involve answers that are no less simple and that evidence implies evidence. A priori and
reversing [7] the terms of the problem, just as one does or does not kill oneself, it seems that there are but two
philosophical solutions, either yes or no. This would be too easy. But allowance must be made for those who,
without concluding, continue questioning. Here I am only slightly indulging in irony: this is the majority. I
notice also that those who answer "no" act as if they thought "yes." As a matter of fact, if I accept the
Nietzschean criterion, they think "yes" in one way or another. On the other hand, it often happens that those
who commit suicide were assured of the meaning of life. These contradictions are constant. It may even be
said that they have never been so keen as on this point where, on the contrary, logic seems so desirable. It is
a commonplace to compare philosophical theories and the behavior of those who profess them. But it must
be said that of the thinkers who refused a meaning to life none except Kirilov who belongs to literature,
Peregrinos who is torn of legend,3 and Jules Lequier who belongs to hypothesis, admitted his logic to the
point of refusing that life. Schopenhauer is often cited, as a fit subject for laughter, because he praised
suicide while seated at a well-set table. This is no subject for joking. That way of not taking the tragic
seriously is not so grievous, but it helps to judge a man.
In the face of such contradictions and obscurities must we conclude that there is no relationship
between [8] the opinion one has about life and the act one commits to leave it? Let us not exaggerate in
this direction. In a man' s attachment to life there is something stronger than all the ills in the world. The
body' s judgment is as good as the mind's, and the body shrinks from annihilation. We get into the habit of
living before acquiring the habit of thinking. In that race which daily hastens us toward death, the body
maintains its irreparable lead. In short, the essence of that contradiction lies in what I shall call the act of
eluding because it is both less and more than diversion in the Pascalian sense. Eluding is the invariable
game. The typical act of eluding, the fatal evasion that constitutes the third theme of this essay, is hope.
Hope of another life one must "deserve" or trickery of those who live not for life itself but for some great
idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it.
Thus everything contributes to spreading confusion. Hitherto, and it has not been wasted effort,
people have played on words and pretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily
leads to declaring that it is not worth living. In truth, there is no necessary common measure between these
two judgments. One merely has to refuse to be misled by the confusions, divorces, and inconsistencies
previously pointed out. One must brush everything aside and go straight to the real problem. One kills
oneself because life is not worth living, that is certainly a truth—yet an unfruitful one because it is a truism.
But does that insult to existence, that flat denial in which it is plunged come from the fact that it has no
meaning? Does its absurdity require one to [9] escape it through hope or suicide—this is what must be
clarified, hunted down, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest. Does the Absurd dictate death?
This problem must be given priority over others, outside all methods of thought and all exercises of the
disinterested mind. Shades of meaning, contradictions, the psychology that an "objective" mind can
always introduce into all problems have no place in this pursuit and this passion. It calls simply for an
unjust—in other words, logical—thought. That is not easy. It is always easy to be logical. It is almost
impossible to be logical to the bitter end. Men who die by their own hand consequently follow to its
conclusion their emotional inclination. Reflection on suicide gives me an opportunity to raise the only
problem to interest me: is there a logic to the point of death? I cannot know unless I pursue, without reckless
passion, in the sole light of evidence, the reasoning of which I am here suggesting the source. This is what I
call an absurd reasoning. Many have begun it. I do not yet know whether or not they kept to it.
3 I have heard of an emulator of Peregrinos, a post-war writer who, after having finished his first book, committed suicide to attract
attention to his work. Attention was in fact attracted, but the book was judged no good.
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 4
When Karl Jaspers, revealing the impossibility of constituting the world as a unity, exclaims:
"This limitation leads me to myself, where I can no longer withdraw behind an objective point of view
that I am merely representing, where neither I myself nor the existence of others can any longer become
an object for me," he is evoking after many others those waterless deserts where thought reaches its
confines. After many others, yes indeed, but how eager they were to get out of them! At that last
crossroad where thought hesitates, many men have arrived and even some of the humblest. They then [10]
abdicated what was most precious to them, their life. Others, princes of the mind, abdicated likewise, but they
initiated the suicide of their thought in its purest revolt. The real effort is to stay there, rather, in so far as that is
possible, and to examine closely the odd vegetation of those distant regions. Tenacity and acumen are privileged
spectators of this inhuman show in which absurdity, hope, and death carry on their dialogue. The mind can then
analyze the figures of that elementary yet subtle dance before illustrating them and reliving them itself.
Absurd Walls
Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying. The regularity of an
impulse or a repulsion in a soul is encountered again in habits of doing or thinking, is reproduced in
consequences of which the soul itself knows nothing. Great feelings take with them their own universe,
splendid or abject. They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which they recognize their climate.
There is a universe of jealousy, of ambition, of selfishness, or of generosity. A universe—in other words, a
metaphysic and an attitude of mind. What is true of already specialized feelings will be even more so of
emotions basically as indeterminate, simultaneously as vague and as "definite," as remote and as "present"
as those furnished us by beauty or aroused by absurdity.
At any streetcorner the feeling of absurdity can strike [11] any man in the face. As it is, in its distressing
nudity, in its light without effulgence, it is elusive. But that very difficulty deserves reflection. It is probably
true that a man remains forever unknown to us and that there is in him something irreducible that escapes
us. But practically I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the totality of their deeds, by the
consequences caused in life by their presence. Likewise, all those irrational feelings which offer no purchase to
analysis. I can de-fine them practically, appreciate them practically, by gathering together the sum of their
consequences in the domain of the intelligence, by seizing and noting all their aspects, by outlining their
universe. It is certain that apparently, though I have seen the same actor a hundred times, I shall not for that
reason know him any better personally. Yet if I add up the heroes he has personified and if I say that I know him
a little better at the hundredth character counted off, this will be felt to contain an element of truth. For this
apparent paradox is also an apologue. There is a moral to it. It teaches that a man defines himself by his make-
believe as well as by his sincere impulses. There is thus a lower key of feelings, inaccessible in the heart but
partially disclosed by the acts they imply and the attitudes of mind they assume. It is clear that in this way I am
defining a method. But it is also evident that that method is one of analysis and not of knowledge. For methods
imply metaphysics; unconsciously they disclose conclusions that they often claim not to know yet. Similarly,
the last pages of a book are already contained in the first pages. Such a link is [12] inevitable. The method
defined here acknowledges the feeling that all true knowledge is impossible. Solely appearances can be
enumerated and the climate make itself felt.
Perhaps we shall be able to overtake that elusive feeling of absurdity in the different but closely
related worlds of intelligence, of the art of living, or of art itself. The climate of absurdity is in the
beginning. The end is the absurd universe and that attitude of mind which lights the world with its true
colors to bring out the privileged and implacable visage which that attitude has discerned in it.

All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning. Great works are often born on a
street-corner or in a restaurant' s revolving door. So it is with absurdity. The absurd world more than
others derives its nobility from that abject birth. In certain situations, replying "nothing" when asked what
one is thinking about may be pretense in a man. Those who are loved are well aware of this. But if that
reply is sincere, if it symbolizes that odd state of soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 5
chain of daily gestures is broken, in which the heart vainly seeks the link that will connect it again, then it
is as it were the first sign of absurdity.
It happens that the stage sets collapse. Rising, street-car, four hours in the office or the factory, meal,
street-car, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and
Saturday according [13] to the same rhythm—this path is easily followed most of the time. But one
day the "why" arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement. "Begins"—this is
important. Weariness comes at the end of the acts of a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates
the impulse of consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what follows. What follows is the
gradual return into the chain or it is the definitive awakening. At the end of the awakening comes, in
time, the consequence: suicide or recovery. In itself weariness has something sickening about it.
Here, I must conclude that it is good. For everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth
anything except through it. There is nothing original about these remarks. But they are obvious; that is
enough for a while, during a sketchy reconnaissance in the origins of the absurd. Mere "anxiety," as
Heidegger says, is at the source of everything.
Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. But a moment always comes
when we have to carry it. We live on the future: "tomorrow," "later on," "when you have made your way,"
"you will understand when you are old enough." Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it' s a
matter of dying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth.
But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he
stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time,
and by the horror that seizes him, [14] he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for
tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.4
A step lower and strangeness creeps in: perceiving that the world is "dense," sensing to what a degree a stone
is foreign and irreducible to us, with what intensity nature or a landscape can negate us. At the heart of all
beauty lies something inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very
minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise.
The primitive hostility of the world rises up to face us across millennia. For a second we cease to understand it
because for centuries we have understood in it solely the images and designs that we had attributed to it
beforehand, because henceforth we lack the power to make use of that artifice. The world evades us because it
becomes itself again. That stage scenery masked by habit becomes again what it is. It withdraws at a distance
from us. Just as there are days when under the familiar face of a woman, we see as a stranger her we had loved
months or years ago, perhaps we shall come even to desire what suddenly leaves us so alone. But the time has
not yet come. Just one thing: that denseness and that strangeness of the world is the absurd.
Men, too, secrete the inhuman. At certain moments [15] of lucidity, the mechanical aspect of their
gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. A man is talking on the
telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you
wonder why he is alive. This discomfort in the face of man' s own inhumanity, this incalculable tumble before
the image of what we are, this "nausea," as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd. Likewise the stranger
who at certain seconds comes to meet us in a mirror, the familiar and yet alarming brother we encounter in our
own photographs is also the absurd.
I come at last to death and to the attitude we have toward it. On this point everything has been said and it is
only proper to avoid pathos. Yet one will never be sufficiently surprised that everyone lives as if no one "knew."
This is because in reality there is no experience of death. Properly speaking, nothing has been experienced but
what has been lived and made conscious. Here, it is barely possible to speak of the experience of others' deaths.
It is a substitute, an illusion, and it never quite convinces us. That melancholy convention cannot be
persuasive. The horror comes in reality from the mathematical aspect of the event. If time frightens us, this
is because it works out the problem and the solution comes afterward. All the pretty speeches about the soul
4 But not in the proper sense. This is not a definition, but rather an enumeration of the feelings that may admit of the absurd.
Still, the enumeration finished, the absurd has nevertheless not been exhausted.
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 6
will have their contrary convincingly proved, at least for a time. From this inert body on which a slap makes
no mark the soul has disappeared. This elementary and definitive aspect of the adventure constitutes the
absurd feeling. Under the fatal lighting of that [16] destiny, its uselessness becomes evident. No code of
ethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our
condition.
Let me repeat: all this has been said over and over. I am limiting myself here to making a rapid
classification and to pointing out these obvious themes. They run through all literatures and all philosophies.
Everyday conversation feeds on them. There is no question of reinventing them. But it is essential to be sure
of these facts in order to be able to question oneself subsequently on the primordial question. I am
interested—let me repeat again—not so much in absurd discoveries as in their consequences. If one is
assured of these facts, what is one to conclude, how far is one to go to elude nothing? Is one to die
voluntarily or to hope in spite of everything? Beforehand, it is necessary to take the same rapid inventory
on the plane of the intelligence.
* * *
The mind' s first step is to distinguish what is true from what is false. However, as soon as thought
reflects on itself, what it first discovers is a contradiction. Useless to strive to be convincing in this case.
Over the centuries no one has furnished a clearer and more elegant demonstration of the business than
Aristotle: "The often ridiculed consequence of these opinions is that they destroy themselves. For by
asserting that all is true we assert the truth of the contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own
thesis (for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true). And if one says that all is false, that
assertion is itself false. If we declare that solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that [17] solely
ours is not false, we are nevertheless forced to admit an infinite number of true or false judgments. For the
one who expresses a true assertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad infinitum."
This vicious circle is but the first of a series in which the mind that studies itself gets lost in a giddy
whirling. The very simplicity of these paradoxes makes them irreducible. Whatever may be the plays on
words and the acrobatics of logic, to understand is, above all, to unify. The mind' s deepest desire, even in
its most elaborate operations, parallels man's unconscious feeling in the face of his universe: it is an
insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity. Understanding the world for a man is reducing it to the
human, stamping it with his seal. The cat's universe is not the universe of the anthill. The truism "All
thought is anthropomorphic" has no other meaning. Likewise, the mind that aims to understand reality can
consider itself satisfied only by reducing it to terms of thought. If man realized that the universe like him
can love and suffer, he would be reconciled. If thought discovered in the shimmering mirrors of
phenomena eternal relations capable of summing them up and summing themselves up in a single
principle, then would be seen an intellectual joy of which the myth of the blessed would be but a
ridiculous imitation. That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute illustrates the essential impulse
of the human drama. But the fact of that nostalgia' s existence does not imply that it is to be immediately
satisfied. For if, bridging the gulf that separates desire from conquest, we assert with Parmenides the
reality of the One (whatever it may be), [18] we fall into the ridiculous contradiction of a mind that asserts total
unity and proves by its very assertion its own difference and the diversity it claimed to resolve. This other vicious
circle is enough to stifle our hopes.
These are again truisms. I shall again repeat that they are not interesting in themselves but in the
consequences that can be deduced from them. I know another truism: it tells me that man is mortal. One can
nevertheless count the minds that have deduced the extreme conclusions from it. It is essential to consider as a
constant point of reference in this essay the regular hiatus between what we fancy we know and what we really
know, practical assent and simulated ignorance which allows us to live with ideas which, if we truly put them to
the test, ought to upset our whole life. Faced with this inextricable contradiction of the mind, we shall fully
grasp the divorce separating us from our own creations. So long as the mind keeps silent in the motionless world
of its hopes, everything is reflected and arranged in the unity of its nostalgia. But with its first move this world
cracks and tumbles: an infinite number of shimmering fragments is offered to the understanding. We must
despair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart. After so many
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 7
centuries of inquiries, so many abdications among thinkers, we are well aware that this is true for all our
knowledge. With the exception of professional rationalists, today people despair of true knowledge. If the only
significant history of human thought were to be written, it would have to be the history of its successive regrets
and its impotences.
[19] Of whom and of what indeed can I say: "I know that!" This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it
exists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is
construction. For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing
but water slipping through my fingers. I can sketch one by one all the aspects it is able to assume, all those
likewise that have been attributed to it, this up bringing, this origin, this ardor or these silences, this nobility or
this vileness. But aspects cannot be added up. This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to
me. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will
never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself. In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth.
Socrates' "Know thyself" has as much value as the "Be virtuous" of our confessionals. They reveal a nostalgia at
the same time as an ignorance. They are sterile exercises on great subjects. They are legitimate only in precisely
so far as they are approximate.
And here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I feel its taste. These scents of grass and stars
at night, certain evenings when the heart relaxes —how shall I negate this world whose power and strength I
feel? Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to
me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are
true. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage you teach me that this wondrous
[20] and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the
electron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in
which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize then that you
have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know. Have I the time to become indignant? You have already
changed theories. So that science that was to teach me everything ends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders
in metaphor, that uncertainty is resolved in a work of art. What need had I of so many efforts? The soft lines of
these hills and the hand of evening on this troubled heart teach me much more. I have returned to my
beginning. I realize that if through science I can seize phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all
that, apprehend the world. Were I to trace its entire relief with my finger, I should not know any more. And
you give me the choice between a description that is sure but that teaches me nothing and hypotheses that
claim to teach me but that are not sure. A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought
that negates itself as soon as it asserts, what is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to
know and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into walls that defy its assaults? To will is to stir
up paradoxes. Everything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that poisoned peace produced by
thoughtlessness, lack of heart, or fatal renunciations.
Hence the intelligence, too, tells me in its way that this world is absurd. Its contrary, blind reason, may
well [21] claim that all is clear; I was waiting for proof and longing for it to be right. But despite so many
pretentious centuries and over the heads of so many eloquent and persuasive men, I know that is false. On this
plane, at least, there is no happiness if I cannot know. That universal reason, practical or ethical, that
determinism, those categories that explain everything are enough to make a decent man laugh. They have
nothing to do with the mind. They negate its profound truth, which is to be enchained. In this unintelligible and
limited universe, man's fate henceforth assumes its meaning. A horde of irrationals has sprung up and surrounds
him until his ultimate end. In his recovered and now studied lucidity, the feeling of the absurd becomes clear
and definite. I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all
that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose
call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. For the moment it is all
that links them together. It binds them one to the other as only hatred can weld two creatures together. This is all
I can discern clearly in this measureless universe where my adventure takes place. Let us pause here. If I hold to
be true that absurdity that determines my relationship with life, if I become thoroughly imbued with that
sentiment that seizes me in face of the world's scenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a
science, I must sacrifice everything to these certainties and I must see them squarely to be able to maintain them.
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 8
Above all, I must adapt my behavior to them [22] and pursue them in all their consequences. I am speaking here
of decency. But I want to know beforehand if thought can live in those deserts.
* * *
I already know that thought has at least entered those deserts. There it found its bread. There it realized that it
had previously been feeding on phantoms. It justified some of the most urgent themes of human reflection.
From the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all. But whether or
not one can live with one' s passions, whether or not one can accept their law, which is to burn the heart they
simultaneously exalt—that is the whole question. It is not, however, the one we shall ask just yet. It stands at
the center of this experience. There will be time to come back to it. Let us recognize rather those
themes and those impulses born of the desert. It will suffice to enumerate them. They, too, are known to all
today. There have always been men to defend the rights of the irrational. The tradition of what may be
called humiliated thought has never ceased to exist. The criticism of rationalism has been made so often
that it seems unnecessary to begin again. Yet our epoch is marked by the rebirth of those paradoxical
systems that strive to trip up the reason as if truly it had always forged ahead. But that is not so much a proof
of the efficacy of the reason as of the intensity of its hopes. On the plane of history, such a constancy of two
attitudes illustrates the essential passion of man torn between his urge toward unity and the clear vision he
may have of the walls enclosing him. But never perhaps at any time has the attack on reason [23] been more
violent than in ours. Since Zarathustra' s great outburst: "By chance it is the oldest nobility in the world. I
conferred it upon all things when I proclaimed that above them no eternal will was exercised," since
Kierkegaard' s fatal illness, "that malady that leads to death with nothing else following it," the significant and
tormenting themes of absurd thought have followed one another. Or at least, and this proviso is of capital
importance, the themes of irrational and religious thought. From Jaspers to Heidegger, from Kierkegaard to
Chestov, from the phenomenologists to Scheler, on the logical plane and on the moral plane, a whole family
of minds related by their nostalgia but opposed by their methods or their aims, have persisted in blocking the
royal road of reason and in recovering the direct paths of truth. Here I assume these thoughts to be known
and lived. Whatever may be or have been their ambitions, all started out from that indescribable universe where
contradiction, antinomy, anguish, or impotence reigns. And what they have in common is precisely the themes
so far disclosed. For them, too, it must be said that what matters above all is the conclusions they have managed
to draw from those discoveries. That matters so much that they must be examined separately. But for the
moment we are concerned solely with their discoveries and their initial experiments. We are concerned solely
with noting their agreement. If it would be presumptuous to try to deal with their philosophies, it is possible and
sufficient in any case to bring out the climate that is common to them.
Heidegger considers the human condition coldly and [24] announces that that existence is humiliated.
The only reality is "anxiety" in the whole chain of beings. To the man lost in the world and its diversions
this anxiety is a brief, fleeting fear. But if that fear becomes conscious of itself, it becomes anguish, the
perpetual climate of the lucid man "in whom existence is concentrated." This professor of philosophy
writes without trembling and in the most abstract language in the world that "the finite and limited
character of human existence is more primordial than man himself." His interest in Kant extends only to
recognizing the restricted character of his "pure Reason." This is to conclude at the end of his analyses
that "the world can no longer offer anything to the man filled with anguish." This anxiety seems to him so
much more important than all the categories in the world that he thinks and talks only of it. He
enumerates its aspects: boredom when the ordinary man strives to quash it in him and benumb it; terror
when the mind contemplates death. He too does not separate consciousness from the absurd. The
consciousness of death is the call of anxiety and "existence then delivers itself its own summons through
the intermediary of consciousness." It is the very voice of anguish and it adjures existence "to return from
its loss in the anonymous They." For him, too, one must not sleep, but must keep alert until the
consummation. He stands in this absurd world and points out its ephemeral character. He seeks his way
amid these ruins.
Jaspers despairs of any ontology because he claims that we have lost "naïveté." He knows that we
can achieve nothing that will transcend the fatal game of [25] appearances. He knows that the end of the
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 9
mind is failure. He tarries over the spiritual adventures revealed by history and pitilessly discloses the
flaw in each system, the illusion that saved everything, the preaching that hid nothing. In this ravaged
world in which the impossibility of knowledge is established, in which everlasting nothingness seems the
only reality and irremediable despair seems the only attitude, he tries to recover the Ariadne's thread that
leads to divine secrets.
Chestov, for his part, throughout a wonderfully monotonous work, constantly straining toward the same
truths, tirelessly demonstrates that the tightest system, the most universal rationalism always stumbles
eventually on the irrational of human thought. None of the ironic facts or ridiculous contradictions that
depreciate the reason escapes him. One thing only interests him, and that is the exception, whether in the
domain of the heart or of the mind. Through the Dostoevskian experiences of the condemned man, the
exacerbated adventures of the Nietzschean mind, Hamlet' s imprecations, or the bitter aristocracy of an
Ibsen, he tracks down, illuminates, and magnifies the human revolt against the irremediable. He refuses the
reason its reasons and begins to advance with some decision only in the middle of that colorless desert where all
certainties have become stones.
Of all perhaps the most engaging, Kierkegaard, for a part of his existence at least, does more than
discover the absurd, he lives it. The man who writes: "The surest of stubborn silences is not to hold one's
tongue but to talk" makes sure in the beginning that no truth is absolute or [26] can render satisfactory
an existence that is impossible in itself. Don Juan of the understanding, he multiplies pseudonyms and
contradictions, writes his Discourses of Edification at the same time as that manual of cynical spiritualism,
The Diary of the Seducer. He refuses consolations, ethics, reliable principles. As for that thorn he feels in
his heart, he is careful not to quiet its pain. On the contrary, he awakens it and, in the desperate joy of a man
crucified and happy to be so, he builds up piece by piece—lucidity, refusal, make-believe—a category of the
man possessed. That face both tender and sneering, those pirouettes followed by a cry from the heart are the
absurd spirit itself grappling with a reality beyond its comprehension. And the spiritual adventure that leads
Kierkegaard to his beloved scandals begins likewise in the chaos of an experience divested of its setting and
relegated to its original incoherence.
On quite a different plane, that of method, Husserl and the phenomenologists, by their very
extravagances, reinstate the world in its diversity and deny the transcendent power of the reason. The
spiritual universe becomes incalculably enriched through them. The rose petal, the milestone, or the
human hand are as important as love, desire, or the laws of gravity. Thinking ceases to be unifying or
making a semblance familiar in the guise of a major principle. Thinking is learning all over again to see,
to be attentive, to focus consciousness; it is turning every idea and every image, in the manner of Proust,
into a privileged moment. What justifies thought is its extreme consciousness. Though more positive than
Kierkegaard' s or Chestov' s, Husserl' s manner [27] of proceeding, in the beginning, nevertheless negates
the classic method of the reason, disappoints hope, opens to intuition and to the heart a whole
proliferation of phenomena, the wealth of which has about it something inhuman. These paths lead to all
sciences or to none. This amounts to saying that in this case the means are more important than the end.
All that is involved is "an attitude for understanding" and not a consolation. Let me repeat: in the
beginning, at very least.
How can one fail to feel the basic relationship of these minds! How can one fail to see that they take
their stand around a privileged and bitter moment in which hope has no further place? I want everything
to be explained to me or nothing. And the reason is impotent when it hears this cry from the heart. The
mind aroused by this insistence seeks and finds nothing but contradictions and nonsense. What I fail to
understand is nonsense. The world is peopled with such irrationals. The world itself, whose single
meaning I do not understand, is but a vast irrational. If one could only say just once: "This is clear," all
would be saved. But these men vie with one another in proclaiming that nothing is clear, all is chaos, that
all man has is his lucidity and his definite knowledge of the walls surrounding him.
All these experiences agree and confirm one another. The mind, when it reaches its limits, must make a
judgment and choose its conclusions. This is where suicide and the reply stand. But I wish to reverse the
order of the inquiry and start out from the intelligent adventure and come back to daily acts. The experiences
called to mind here were born in the desert that we must not leave [28] behind. At least it is essential to
Camus: The Myth of Sisyphus 10
know how far they went. At this point of his effort man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels
within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the
human need and the unreasonable silence of the world. This must not be forgotten. This must be clung to
because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the
absurd that is born of their encounter—these are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily
end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.
Philosophical Suicide
The feeling of the absurd is not, for all that, the notion of the absurd. It lays the foundations for it, and
that is all. It is not limited to that notion, except in the brief moment when it passes judgment on the
universe. Subsequently it has a chance of going further. It is alive; in other words, it must die or else
reverberate. So it is with the themes we have gathered together. But there again what interests me is not
works or minds, criticism of which would call for another form and another place, but the discovery of
what their conclusions have in common. Never, perhaps, have minds been so different. And yet we
recognize as identical the spiritual landscapes in which they get under way. Likewise, despite such
dissimilar zones of knowledge, the cry that terminates their itinerary rings out in the same way. It is
evident that the thinkers we have just recalled have a common climate. [29]To say that that climate is
deadly scarcely amounts to playing on words. Living under that stifling sky forces one to get away or to
stay. The important thing is to find out how people get away in the first case and why people stay in the
second case. This is how I define the problem of suicide and the possible interest in the conclusions of
existential philosophy.
But first I want to detour from the direct path. Up to now we have managed to circumscribe the absurd
from the outside. One can, however, wonder how much is clear in that notion and by direct analysis try to
discover its meaning on the one hand and, on the other, the consequences it involves.
If I accuse an innocent man of a monstrous crime, if I tell a virtuous man that he has coveted his own
sister, he will reply that this is absurd. His indignation has its comical aspect. But it also has its
fundamental reason. The virtuous man illustrates by that reply the definitive antinomy existing between
the deed I am attributing to him and his lifelong principles. "It's absurd" means "It's impossible" but also
"It's contradictory." If I see a man armed only with a sword attack a group of machine guns, I shall
consider his act to be absurd. But it is so solely by virtue of the disproportion between his intention and
the reality he will encounter, of the contradiction I notice between his true strength and the aim he has in
view. Likewise we shall deem a verdict absurd when we contrast it with the verdict the facts apparently
dictated. And, similarly, a demonstration by the absurd is achieved by comparing the consequences of
such a reasoning with the logical reality one wants to [30] set up. In all these cases, from the simplest to
the most complex, the magnitude of the absurdity will be in direct ratio to the distance between the two
terms of my comparison. There are absurd marriages, challenges, rancors, silences, wars, and even peace
treaties. For each of them the absurdity springs from a comparison. I am thus justified in saying that the
feeling of absurdity does not spring from the mere scrutiny of a fact or an impression, but that it bursts from
the comparison between a bare fact and a certain reality, between an action and the world that transcends it.
The absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their
confrontation.
In this particular case and on the plane of intelligence, I can therefore say that the Absurd is not in man
(if such a metaphor could have a meaning) nor in the world, but in their presence together. For the moment
it is the only bond uniting them. If I wish to limit myself to facts, I know what man wants, I know what the
world offers him, and now I can say that I also know what links them. I have no need to dig deeper. A single
certainty is enough for the seeker. He simply has to derive all the consequences from it.


If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. This word is not
too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and [122] the sorrow was in the beginning.
When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too insistent,
it happens that melancholy arises in man's heart: this is the rock's victory, this is the rock itself. The
boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing truths perish from
being acknowledged. Thus, Œdipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from the moment he
knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, blind and desperate, he realizes that the only bond
linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: "Despite so many
ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well." Sophocles'
Œdipus, like Dostoevsky's Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for the absurd victory. Ancient wisdom confirms
modern heroism.
One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happiness. "What! by
such narrow ways—? " There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the
same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the
absurd discovery. It happens as well that the felling of the absurd springs from happiness. "I conclude that
all is well," says Œdipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It
teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with
dissatisfaction and a preference for futile suffering. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be
settled among men.
[123]All Sisyphus' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing
Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols. In the universe
suddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise up. Unconscious,
secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse and price of victory. There is no
sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night. The absurd man says yes and his efforts will
henceforth be unceasing. If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there is, but one
which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the rest, he knows himself to be the master of his
days. At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his
rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate,
created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the
wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end,
he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.
I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus
teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This
universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each
mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights
is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
