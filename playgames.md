Playing games is the voluntary practice of engaging unnecessary obstacles.  Let's break this into two parts: the act of Play and the environment of Games.

Play is necessary for engagement at work.  Have you ever seen someone who was disengaged in play?  I have seen people disengaged at work, in fact surveys show XX% of people are either not engaged or actively disengaged at work.  Most work simply is not structured as play.  Now maybe you will say that work can't always be fun.  Play is not necessarily fun.  When an NFL player is playing Linebacker and crashes into other 300 pound men, its not necessarily fun.  When a violinist is playing first chair at the Met Opera.  Its not necessarily fun.  However, they are playing a role in a high stakes game.  Because they are playing, they are actively engaged to harness their creativity to make adjustments to the game, to add feeling to their play.  People who play are more creative in solving problems and generate alpha, the unexpected upside to the work that can not to commanded ahead of time.  

Another characteristic of play is that we are open to failing.  We do tasks at a challenging level which opens up the risk to failure but also greater accomplishment.  When we do fail, we are not discouraged, we get excited to play again.  Play becomes a practice that we fall in love with, a process that we keep repeating voluntarily with no manager watching.  What's the value of this repeated practice?  For hard complex tasks, it allows the player to gain experience so they are not doing it for the first time, when everything is on the line.  Going meta, the player is praticing the skills of taking action, of making decisions, and of solving problems.  These are the power skills that can't simply be taught in a textbook.  They are muscles that need to be excercised or they wither when you really need to get things right.  

Call to action: rethink how you do work.  How can you change your mindset to play, the practice of solving problems?


Games are structured to keep people playing.  Good games teach you how to play and provide constant feedback to nudge you in the right direction.  If you fail, get another life or start another game and go again.  When you get a high score, you get to put your name on the leader board.  High fives all around!

At the core all games share four components: a clear goal, a set of rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation.  I'm not sure the same can be said about work.  A bad workplace does not give their employees a clear goal and sometimes different departments have different goals which compete with each other.  The rules change, some rules are hidden, and sometimes there are different rules for different people.  The feedback system does not exsist or no longer helps people do their job better.  People don't want to be there!

But not all is lost.  Some rare companies are built with a clear vision presented to everyone, the rules are carefully crafted, feedback is meant to nuture their people instead of punish, and as you can imagine, people love working there.  So why don't all companies design to better follow games?  One possibility is: they didn't read the right books ;P Another possibility is that they started the right way, grew organically, and then things got out of hand ::scary music::
