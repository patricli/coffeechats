We have a lot of good chats on CoffeeOps and some reoccuring topics appear but we do not yet have a good follow up for people to take away and come back with further questions.  This is meant to be a living log to accumulate common answers and resources.


Q) How do I get started in Tech? I am a ...new grad/nontraditional background/changing careers/returning after hiatus.

A) Many of the best people in tech do not have formal training in tech but are voracious learners and picked things up by reading and doing. Often people who started outside tech bring new perspectives to problem solving that help break through barriers. There are many resources to help you get started, here are a select few:

- Harvard CS50: Intro to Computer Science is free on Youtube and provides a great all around foundation on tech <br>

- In CoffeeOps, we have a lot of folks in the Site Reliability Engineering role.  They manage the systems that software engineers use and deploy on, though specific responsibilities will vary.  LinkedIn shared their onboarding course - <br>

-  DevOps is more than a set of tools or culture.  It combines new ways of thinking and working to delivery better outcomes, faster. <br>

Q) Are certifications important? 
A) There are different perspectives on this and its a great question to ask around about.  Most people tend to agree that they are nice to have but not necessary and many effective engineers never took any certs.  As you get later in your career, certs matter less but there can be some benefits to: <br>

a - Signaling to an employer that you have done some work on this area and can focus long enough to study  <br>
b - Provides a good framework to study from, but taking the exam is optional  <br>
c - Differentiates you from other novices, BUT is not a substitute for problem solving experience <br>

Q) Are job titles important? Depends on your own definition of success and context of the organization.

Titles may provide you with a sense of career progression that has the very real benefit of motivating you to stick with the career for longer. It can be an incremental chain of milestones to help you break down a really big goal. Titles can potentially help you bargain for higher salary when changing companies. However, in CoffeeOps discussions we've come to agree that titles are not consistent across companies and industries. In some companies, your title never changes even as you become more senior. Recruiters are probably catching on to this.

Titles may have importance in the context of your organization. It may empower you to lead a large team to pursuit an initiative. It may give you authority to spend over a certain budget on a tool or hire a new employee. It is less about personal pride but more about hierarchy.

Q) How do we develop a culture of remote work?
Q) What are the norms of a healthy workplace?
