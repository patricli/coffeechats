Why I created this?

I was looking for a tool to address the way I work.  I was hoping the Gathertown coworking would be a good motivation and accountability tool and while its helpful, I find its still missing some structure.  The structure is most similar to the Standup ritual used by agile development teams.  It relies on the principles of transparency of work, support over shaming of tasks, continuous and gradual progress, and asynch work styles.  

Currently in the community, I find that people are joining from all over the world and have different start and end times.  There is not always a community aspect of hearing what cool things other people are working on.  Also the Gathertown app can slow down the computer and be a distraction from the main work.

On a personal level, I wanted something that tracked a streak of work but not for doing the same  task everyday.  Habit trackers have great interfaces but it only accomodates for repetitive tasks as opposed to incremental progress on a project.  I wanted something that could be a part of my rituals to check in and start work then check out and disconnect from work.  I didn't want to have to find someone to stare at me on video any time I wanted to do work or wherever I was working. In fact, I try to work offline and away from screens as much as possible.  Yet none of these mechanisms that may be useful for a point in time are excluded with this method.
